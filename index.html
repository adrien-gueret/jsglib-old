      <h3>Develop video games with JavaScript</h3>

      <p><strong>JSGlib</strong> is a JavaScript library that makes the videogames development on the web easier.
      It manages for you the common events in any games : elements displaying,
      interactions with players, objects moving, collision handling...</p>

      <p>With <strong>JSGlib</strong>, you only have to write the code to run during these events!</p>

      <h3>Where is the doc... ?!</h3>

      <p>This project is quiet old and the whole documentation has been lost... Sorry for that.</p>

      <p>
        This <strong>GitHub</strong> repo contains the version 3.0 of the library: it's totally usable
        but the doc has vanished...
        Fortunately, the source code is well commented and you should be able to know how to use main
        features by yourself.
      </p>

      <h3>What's next?</h3>

      <p>
        The current version of <strong>JSGlib</strong> is 3.0. It's quite old nowadays and a lot of things could
        be optimized: this one of my goals.
      </p>

      <p>You can meanwhile test some demos made with more or less old versions of the project:</p>

      <em>Soon</em>
