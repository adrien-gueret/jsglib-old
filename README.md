# JSGlib
## JavaScript Gaming Library

### Develop video games with JavaScript

**JSGlib** is a JavaScript library that makes the videogames development on the web easier.
It manages for you the common events in any games : elements displaying,
interactions with players, objects moving, collision handling...

With **JSGlib**, you only have to write the code to run during these events!

###  Where is the doc... ?!

This project is quiet old and the whole documentation has been lost... Sorry for that.

This **GitHub** repo contains the version 3.0 of the library: it's totally usable but the doc has vanished... Fortunatelu, the source code is well commented and you should be able to know how to use main features by yourself.

### What's next?

The current version of **JSGlib** is 3.0. It's quite old nowadays and a lot of things could be optimized: this one of my goals.

You can meanwhile test some demos made with more or less old versions of the project:
